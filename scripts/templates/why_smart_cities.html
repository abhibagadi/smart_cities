            <h3 class="mt-4">Why Smart Cities?</h3> 
            <p>Against the background of economic and technological changes caused by the globalization and the integration process, cities in India face the challenge of combining competitiveness and sustainable urban development simultaneously. Very evidently, this challenge is likely to have an impact on issues of Urban Quality such as housing, economy, culture, social and environmental conditions. This project, however, does not deal with the leading European metropolises but with medium-sized cities and their perspectives for development. Even though the public attention the vast majority of the urban population lives in such cities, the main focus of urban research tends to be on the 'global' metropolises. As a result, the challenges of medium-sized cities, which can be rather different, remain unexplored to a certain degree. Medium-sized cities, which have to cope with competition of the larger metropolises on corresponding issues, appear to be less well equipped in terms of critical mass, resources and organizing capacity.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-4">Why Another Ranking and benchmarking?</h3>
            <p>To enforce an endogen development and achieve a good position, these cities have to aim on identifying their strengths and weaknesses as well as to identify their chances for positioning and to ensure and extend comparative advantages in certain key resources against other cities of the same level. City rankings are a tool to identify these assets. Although they are quite common in recent time, current rankings are very different in their approaches or methods. Mostly they have quite specific aims focused on shareholder interests. Also, the local governments seldom discuss ranking results in public, if the own city is not ranked high. Due to different interests behind rankings and the indicators and methodological approaches used it is also normal that one city is ranked very different in different rankings. Additionally, medium-sized cities are often not considered when they are not recognised on a global level which would actually premise already a very good position.</p>

In Survey Form, current status of infrastructure and expected infrastructure in smart city from the Stakeholder's (People) point of view is analyzed. Whereas in secondary data, current situation of infrastructure is analysized, according to availability of data on each parameter. Methodology does not only include the way of data collection and processing but in a first step it also covers the actual limitation of the selection of cities examined in the ranking. The focus of this ranking lies on District places of Vidharbh region of Maharashtra. The Vidharbha's district places are selected due to the availability of secondary data.
